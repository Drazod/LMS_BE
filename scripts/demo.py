    Welcome to today's lecture on renewable energy sources. In this session, we will discuss 
    the three main types of renewable energy: solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. 
    
    Solar energy is harnessed using photovoltaic panels that convert sunlight directly into 
    electricity. This technology has become increasingly efficient and cost-effective over 
    the past decade. Many countries are now investing heavily in solar farms to reduce their 
    carbon footprint.
    
    Wind energy, on the other hand, uses turbines to capture the kinetic energy of moving air. 
    Wind farms are typically located in areas with consistent wind patterns, such as coastal 
    regions or open plains. The technology has advanced significantly, with modern turbines 
    being much more efficient than their predecessors.
    
    Lastly, hydroelectric power generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water. 
    This can be achieved through large dams or smaller run-of-river systems. Hydroelectric 
    power is one of the oldest forms of renewable energy and continues to be a major source 
    of clean electricity worldwide.
    
    Each of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and challenges. Solar energy 
    is abundant but depends on weather conditions. Wind energy is clean but can be intermittent. 
    Hydroelectric power is reliable but may have environmental impacts on river ecosystems.
